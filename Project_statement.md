**8-1 Roll Your Own Mini Search Engine**

分数 20

In this project, you are supposed to create your own mini search engine which can handle inquiries over “The Complete Works of William Shakespeare” (http://shakespeare.mit.edu/).

You may download the functions for handling stop words and stemming from the Internet, as long as you add the source in your reference list.

Your tasks are:

- (1) Run a word count over the Shakespeare set and try to identify the stop words (also called the **noisy** words) – How and where do you draw the line between “interesting” and “noisy” words?
- (2) Create your inverted index over the Shakespeare set with word stemming. The stop words identified in part (1) must not be included.
- (3) Write a query program on top of your inverted file index, which will accept a user-specified word (or phrase) and return the IDs of the documents that contain that word.
- (4) Run tests to show how the thresholds on query may affect the results.

### Grading Policy:

**Programming:** Write the programs for word counting (1 pt.), index generation (5 pts.) and query processing (3 pts.) with sufficient comments.

**Testing:** Design tests for the correctness of the inverted index (2 pts.) and thresholding for query (2 pts.).  Write analysis and comments (3 pts.).  **Bonus: What if you have 500 000 files and 400 000 000 distinct words?  Will your program still work? (+2 pts.)**

**Documentation:** Chapter 1 (1 pt.), Chapter 2 (2 pts.), and finally a complete report (1 point for overall style of documentation).

**Note:** Anyone who does excellent job on answering the Bonus question will gain extra points.
