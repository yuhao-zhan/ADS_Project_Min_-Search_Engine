# ADS_Project_Mini_Search_Engine
This is our first ads project: Mini Search Engine.

For the `documents` directory, there are totally three items: README.md, report.pdf and a folder `results`. 

For the  folder(.zip file) `results`, there are several things needing your attention:

1. One subdirectory is `csv`, which stores all the results in the "test" part. And there are totally 42 .csv files in it for different query types and thresholds.
2. The other subdirectory is `visualization`, which contains all the visulized results of the `.csv` files with bar charts form. And there are totally 84 `.png` images in its, 2 times as the number of `.csv` files due to the split of single-word queries and two-word queries.
