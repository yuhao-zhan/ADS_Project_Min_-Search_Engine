# Error Analysis

The providing stemming algorithm appears to follow the Porter stemming rules, which can handle a variety of English words. However, there are some limitations and edge cases that might not be effectively managed:
### 1.Irregular Verbs:
Some irregular verbs(e.g. "went" or "saw") are not stemmed properly. The algorithm primarily focused on suffixes, and since these words don't conform to standard morphological rules, they may remain unchanged or become inappropriate stems.
### 2.Compound Words:
Words like "toothbrush" or "mother-in-law" are treated as single entities, which may lead to incorrect stemming since the algorithm does not account for compound structures.
### 3.Proper Nouns:
The algorithm does not differentiate between common and proper nouns. For instance, "Smith" might be treated like "smite", resulting in inappropriate stemming for names.
### 4.Non-Standard Conjugations:
Variants like "running," "jogging," or even colloquial forms(e.g. "gonna") may not stem accurately. The algorithm could misinterpret these forms because it relies heavily on fixed suffix patterns.
### 5.Words with Multiple Meanings:
Homographs(words that are spelled the same but have different meanings, such as "lead" as a verb vs. "lead" as a noun) might be mis-stemmed since the algorithm does not consider context.
### 6.Loanwords and Foreign Terms:
Words borrowed from other languages may not conform to English morphological rules, leading to incorrect stemming. For instance, "cafe" or "fiance" could be incorrectly altered.
### 7.Exeption Handling:
There is no mechanism for exceptions to rules. Words that defy conventional endings, like "sphinx", might not stem as intended because they don't fit the standard patterns.
### 8.Edge Cases with Suffix Removal:
The handling of suffixes in some cases could lead to ambiguous stems.Far example, the removal of "ed" from "hopped" results in "hop", but in "hoped", it might be incorrectly handled if the measure is miscalculated.
### 9.Phonetic Varations:
The algorithm does not account for phonetic variations, such as regional dialects(e.g. "color" vs. "colour"), which could lead to different stemming results in practice.
### 10.Handling of Special Characters:
While there is some basic punctuation removal, the algorithm may not handle hypens or other special characters effectively, leading to unintended stems.
